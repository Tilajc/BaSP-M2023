# BaSP-m2023

I am going to do a web page as final activity for radium rocket course

## Week-01

During the first week I have been working with figma. I worked in the admin section designing the screenflow.

## Week-02

During the second week I have been working with HTML, Git, and Github. I adapted the landing page to HTML, and then Uploaded the HTML on Github using Git.

## Week-03

During the third week I have been working with HTML, CSS, Git, and Github. I did the pixel perfect page just like we did in figma.
