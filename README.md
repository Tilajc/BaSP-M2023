# BaSP-m2023

I am going to do a web page as final activity for radium rocket course

## Week-01

During the first week I have been working with figma. I worked in the admin section designing the screenflow.

## Week-02

During the second week I have been working with HTML, Git, and Github. I adapted the landing page to HTML, and then Uploaded the HTML on Github using Git.

## Run Week-02 with github pages

```bash
  https://tilajc.github.io/BaSP-M2023/week-02/index.html
```

## Week-03

During the third week I have been working with HTML, CSS, Git, and Github. I did the pixel perfect page just like we did in figma.

## Run Week-03 with github pages

```bash
  https://tilajc.github.io/BaSP-M2023/week-03/index.html
```

## Week-04

During the four week I have been working with HTML, CSS, Git, and Github again. But this time I did the gym page responsive using Flexbox and Media Queries.

## Run Week-04 with github pages

```bash
  https://tilajc.github.io/BaSP-M2023/week-04/index.html
```

## Week-05

During the fifth week I have been working with JavaScript, and fixed some errors from the fourth week. This time I did some exercises to print in the console.

## Run Week-05 with github pages

```bash
  https://tilajc.github.io/BaSP-M2023/week-05/index.html
```

## Week-06

During the sixth week I have been working with HTML, CSS, Git, Github, and javascript again. This time I did the login, and sign up form, and validate the input values for every input type using DOM management.

## Run Week-06 with github pages

```bash
  https://tilajc.github.io/BaSP-M2023/week-06/views/index.html
```

## Week-07

During the seventh week I have been working with Git, Github, and javascript. This time I added an API verification into the login form, where the valid email is "rose@radiumrocket.com", and the valid password is "BaSProfessional1". And in signup if you fill the fields with valid information that's will fill the local storage, and when you left the page and enter again you will have the form completed with this data.
